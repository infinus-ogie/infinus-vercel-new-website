## üìà In GA4 Dashboard, You Should See:

1. **Realtime Reports:**
   - Active users
   - Page views with paths (/grow, /professional-services, etc.)
   - file_download events when clicking downloads

2. **Events to Monitor:**
   - `page_view` - Every page load
   - `file_download` - ZIP and PDF downloads
   - `session_start` - New sessions

---

## üéØ What Changed (Temporary Hotfix):

### Files Modified:

1. **app/layout.tsx**
   - ‚úÖ Added GA4 scripts directly in `<head>`
   - ‚úÖ Mounted GAFast component for page_view tracking
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è Commented out: GoogleAnalytics, RouteChangeTracker

2. **app/_components/GAFast.tsx** (NEW)
   - ‚úÖ Fires page_view on mount
   - ‚úÖ Fires page_view on route changes
   - ‚úÖ No consent checks

3. **app/_components/ViClickTracker.tsx**
   - ‚úÖ Removed consent checks
   - ‚úÖ Uses capture phase
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom events may need tuning (browser auto-track working)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations (Temporary):

1. **No Consent Mode v2:**
   - Tracking is unconditional
   - Not GDPR-compliant yet
   - Will restore after campaign

2. **No Custom Event Names:**
   - Using browser's auto `file_download` 
   - Custom `vi_zip_click` / `vi_download_click` can be added if needed
   - Auto-tracking is sufficient for campaign

3. **No D&B VI Integration:**
   - D&B Visitor Intelligence disabled
   - Can re-enable after campaign if needed

---

## üîÑ How to Revert (After Campaign):

```bash
# 1. Edit app/layout.tsx:
#    - Remove <Script> tags from <head>
#    - Remove <GAFast />
#    - Uncomment <GoogleAnalytics /> and <RouteChangeTracker />

# 2. Edit app/_components/ViClickTracker.tsx:
#    - Restore consent checks

# 3. Commit:
git add app/layout.tsx app/_components/ViClickTracker.tsx
git commit -m "Restore Consent Mode v2 after campaign"
git push origin main
```
